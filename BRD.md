## Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Crypto Data Processing System

### 1. Introduction
The Crypto Data Processing System is a project aimed at efficiently fetching, processing, and storing cryptocurrency market data from various sources. This document outlines the business requirements for the development of the system.

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the scope, objectives, and functional requirements of the Crypto Data Processing System.

#### 1.2 Scope
The system will fetch cryptocurrency market data from external APIs, process the data, store it in a data warehouse, and provide insights for analysis. It will automate data retrieval, transformation, and loading processes to enable accurate and timely data analysis.

### 2. Business Objectives
The main objectives of the Crypto Data Processing System include:

- Efficiently fetch and retrieve cryptocurrency market data from external sources.
- Process and transform the raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
- Store processed data in a data warehouse for historical analysis and reporting.
- Provide automation and scheduling capabilities to ensure regular data updates.
- Support data integrity, accuracy, and reliability for analysis purposes.

### 3. Functional Requirements
The Crypto Data Processing System shall include the following functionalities:

#### 3.1 Data Retrieval
- Fetch cryptocurrency market data from external APIs using provided API keys.
- Implement multithreaded data retrieval to optimize performance.
- Maintain a list of supported symbols for data retrieval.

#### 3.2 Data Processing
- Process and cleanse raw data to remove inconsistencies and errors.
- Calculate derived metrics such as candlestick patterns, moving averages, and relative strength indices.
- Identify missing data and handle data gaps appropriately.

#### 3.3 Data Storage
- Store processed data in a designated data warehouse.
- Design and implement tables for dimensions (e.g., symbols, resolutions) and facts (e.g., candlestick data).
- Ensure data integrity through appropriate primary keys and foreign key relationships.

#### 3.4 Automation
- Provide scheduling mechanisms to automatically fetch and update data at specified intervals.
- Implement error handling and notifications in case of data retrieval or processing failures.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
#### 4.1 Performance
- The system shall be capable of handling a high volume of data requests concurrently.
- Data retrieval and processing shall be optimized for efficiency and low latency.

#### 4.2 Security
- Sensitive information, such as API keys, shall be securely stored and managed.
- Access controls shall be implemented to restrict unauthorized access to the system.

#### 4.3 Reliability
- The system shall maintain data integrity and accuracy throughout the data processing pipeline.
- Automated retries and error logging shall be implemented to ensure reliability.

### 5. Constraints
- The system shall operate within the limitations of the external APIs being used.
- Data storage and processing resources shall be allocated as per the available infrastructure.

### 6. Assumptions
- The external APIs used for data retrieval will be available and functional.
- The data warehouse infrastructure will be provisioned and accessible.

### 7. Glossary
- **API**: Application Programming Interface, a set of rules allowing different software applications to communicate with each other.
- **Data Warehouse**: A centralized repository that stores data from various sources for analytical and reporting purposes.
- **Candlestick**: A graphical representation of price movements in financial markets.
